Solar System Registry

This program allows users to manipulate a registry of solar systems, stars, planets, and moons. The registry is stored in a file called solarsystems.data.
Main Menu

The program presents the following options to the user:

    1 SELECT SOLAR SYSTEM
    2 ADD BODY
    3 REMOVE BODY
    4 LIST SYSTEMS
    5 SORT BY SIZE
    6 SORT BY ORBITAL SIZE
    7 QUIT AND SAVE

    Option 1: Select a solar system from the registry
    Option 2: Add a new body (star, planet, or moon) to the selected solar system
    Option 3: Remove a body from the selected solar system
    Option 4: List all the solar systems in the registry
    Option 5: Sort the bodies in the selected solar system by size (radius)
    Option 6: Sort the bodies in the selected solar system by orbital size (orbit radius)
    Option 7: Quit the program and save the changes to the registry file

    After selecting option 4, 5 or 6 from the main menu, the program presents the following options:

    4. Listing all the systems in registry file.
    5. Listing all the system and sorted by the size.
    6. Listing all the systems and sorted by the orbtial size.

5. The FileHandling class handles the reading and writing of the registry file:

    FileHandling registry = new FileHandling("solarsystems.data");
