# Reflection on my Intended Design
Follow the instructions and write the report in this file.
My class diagrams, there was too many missing classes that are tile, property, free, start,consoleui and humanplayer. Because i was thinking in general when i draw my diagrams, now i understand that the UML diagrams are made to help programmers write their own code. And no, I did not have any extra classes, because i did not create enough classes. yes, i had computerplayer and user, to make it easier for programmers to find erorrs and to define the tasks of each class.Yes, because i used only association between the classes in my design, but the right class diagram have dependency, association, and realization relations. No, i did not use any of that. I created a main class that was main and this should contain the most impotant attributes and methods in the application. Also there were missing objects in my diagram like property, start,consoleui and humanplayer and the relations was wrong as well. In my ssequence diagram there were missing seqences, because i did not create all the classes that i need. No, because there were many missing classes, that mean there were missing importent methods and attributes which will negativly affect the output of our application. Finally I want to say that software design is very important to help the programmer to write programs in easier ways by categorizing programs into classes and defining the tasks of each class, which facilitates the programmer's work
